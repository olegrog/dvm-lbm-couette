# DVM-LBM for the Couette-flow problem

Hybrid finite-volume solver based on the lattice-Boltzmann &amp; discrete-velocity methods for the Couette problem.

The code is based on the algorithm presented in
 - V. V. Aristov, O. V. Ilyin, O. A. Rogozin, Kinetic multiscale scheme based on the discrete-velocity and lattice-Boltzmann methods.
